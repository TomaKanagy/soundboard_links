#This folder contains the soundbites that I personally added to my soundboard. It's a lot of clips of 70's soft rock bands bc I'm hip with the kids like that 😎

#Soundboard.py works by reading soundboard.csv, so if a file is not listed in soundboard.csv then soundboard.py doesn't know about it. 
#The soundboard.csv that is displayed in this repository is just an example of what one should look like; soundboard.py will generate its own soundboard.csv if you use the --add <your_direct_link_here> command-line argument.
